# **Computational Mathematics Final Project**

## 📌 Overview
This project is a web-based computational mathematics tool that implements various numerical methods for solving mathematical problems. It provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and analyze different numerical techniques.

## 🔧 Features
- **Graphical Method & Absolute Error** – Finds function roots and compares accuracy with Newton’s method.
- **Root-Finding Methods** – Implements Iterative and Newton-Raphson methods for root approximation.
- **Gauss-Seidel Method** – Solves systems of linear equations iteratively.
- **LU Factorization** – Decomposes matrices into lower and upper triangular matrices for efficient solving.
- **Polynomial Curve Fitting** – Fits a polynomial curve to given data points.
- **Lagrange Interpolation** – Uses Lagrange's formula to approximate values between known points.
- **Euler’s Method** – Solves differential equations using numerical approximation.
- **Boole’s Rule** – Performs numerical integration using the Newton-Cotes quadrature rule.
